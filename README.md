What we plan on doing next
1. Between now and next Monday try to figure out how to have it predict multiple classes (currently only predicts class 7).
2. Adding data augmentation will defently help redice overfitting. 
3. Partion testing/ validation for the different data sets. 
4. Increase generability of model. 

Evaluating the model 
1. Average Mean Percision Score- Takes average of percision of all classes.
2. Accuracy is also good for more general score.
